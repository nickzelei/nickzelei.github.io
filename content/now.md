# now

_Last Updated: July 6th, 2023_

## Work
These days my days are focused on my startup, Nucleus. It's still early days and things are exciting. We just moved into our new office in Union Square.

## Reading
I bought a Kobo and have been reading a lot more lately.

* Shift (in-progress)
* Wool
* Dune

## Watching
* Silo
* Foundation
* Etc. Trash TV

## Exercise
I am keeping to a steady kettlebell routine 3-4 times a week.
I'm following simple & sinister and do so with a mixture of 24kg and 20kg kettlebells.
Swings with the 24kg, Get-ups with the 20kg.

I'm also trying to keep up running about ~10 miles a week.

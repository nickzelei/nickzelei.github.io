# Land's End on a Sunny Day

Most weekends involve setting out for a long walk and seeing where the day takes us. It's good exercise and allows us to see new parts of the city that we haven't explored yet. Alternatively, it allows us to revisit an existing area to discover something new.

It's been raining [a lot](https://www.kron4.com/news/san-francisco-no-longer-in-drought-according-to-latest-data/?ipid=promo-link-block1) here recently, what feels like nonstop the last three months. It's good for the city and state.

Today, however, was sunny and in the 60s - a perfect SF day. We've been to Land's End many times now over the years that we've lived here, yet we still discover new places tucked away. The absolute beauty that this city offers is unmatched and is one of the main reasons why I continue to call SF my home.

Set out for a walk or bike. Eat brunch at Lokma, check out some art at the Legion of Honor, then hike Land's End for breath taking views. Tell me you didn't have a good day.
